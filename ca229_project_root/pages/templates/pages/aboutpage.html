        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>Every Morning, our system sends a new challange onto every member's device for them to complete in the given 24-hour period. 
            These challanges range from core muscle workouts, yoga or even something as simple as running or walking a few kilometres. Some challanges 
            even have some sub-challanges included if you really want to test yourself. The sub-challanges are completely optional and are only 
            included to help introduce you to other workouts like doing the plank, push ups and even some gymnastics for the adventurous people.
